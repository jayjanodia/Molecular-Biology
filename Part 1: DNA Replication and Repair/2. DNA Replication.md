# DNA Replication

- Single most important reason for DNA Replication: Duplicate the cells' genome

## Properties of DNA Replication

1. **Rapid**: 100 - 1000 bp/sec synthesized by a typical DNA replication machine
2. **Complete**: Every base pair MUST be replicated in the genome
3. **Accurate**: Machinary makes 1 mistake in 10^10^ base pairs syntheized

## Applications of DNA Replication

- **Molecular Cloning**: Can splice genes together or make all sorts of different things
- **PCR**
- **Massive Sequencing**: We can sequence entire genomes including our own.
- **Chemotherapy**: Target DNA Replication
- **Antivirals**: Anti-AIDS

### Question 1

DNA polymerase found in E. coli cells synthesizes DNA around 1000 nucleotides per second. How many seconds will it take one DNA polymerase to synthesize one strand of the E. coli genome (4.6 \* 10^6^ base pairs)? Do not include any commas in your answer.

> 1000 nucleotides/sec. 4.6 \* 10^6^ \/ 1000 = 4.6 \* 10^6^ \/ 10^3^ = 4.6 \* 10^3^ = 4600

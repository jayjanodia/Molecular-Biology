# Design proteins

One of the most important types of proteins: Enzymes

- If you are a bacteria, eg. E. Coli, that has an inner membrane and an outer membrane.
- You want to let molecules from the outer membrane into the inner membrane. The molecules are not too big, eg of 600 molecular weight (size of ATP)
- We don't want positively charged or negatively charged molecules to get in, ie polar molecules

- One solution is to use a Beta Barrel on the outer membrane.
- We know that the structure of the membrane is hydrophyllic on the outside and hydrophobic on the inside
- If the barrel was going to sit in a membrane and be in contact with the surrounding hydrophobic space, we would like non-polar hydrophobic amino acids around it's outside
- Now we want a hole that should be the size of upto 600 molecular weight. The hole will have some charged residues (amino acid side chains) so that other positive and negative charges get repelled

## Question 1

When considering a protein which functions as a pore through the membrane, where would you expect to find a high percentage of the amino acids like phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine? You may want to use the amino acids chart in the biochemistry graphics box of the resource box to help you answer this question.

### Answer

On the surface that interacts with the phospholipid tails of the membrane.

## What is an Enzyme

**Triose Phosphate Isomerase** (TIM) - 3 carbon sugar

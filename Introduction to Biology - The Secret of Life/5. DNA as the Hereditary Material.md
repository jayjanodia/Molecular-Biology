# DNA as the Hereditary Material

## Structure of DNA

3 Basic Components:

1. Sugar
   **2'-deoxyribose** - 5 carbon sugar
   ![2' Deoxyribose](https://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Fg10_09b_revised.gif)

2. Base
   The base hangs off the 1' carbon. There are 4 types of base

   - 2 are a 6-membered ring and a 5-membered ring
   - 3 of them has a 6-membered ring

3. Tri-Phosphate
   The three phosphate groups hanging off the 5' carbon

### Question 1

Each DNA nucleotide has which of the following features. Check all that apply.

#### Answer 1

1. A single deoxyribose
2. A nitrogenous base (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine) attached to the 1’ carbon of the sugar
3. 1, 2, or 3 phosphate groups attached to the 5’ carbon of the sugar

## Bacterial Viruses

- Bacteria deal with viruses
- Viruses can attach to bacteria and destroy them in 20-30 minutes
- When viruses kill the bacteria, the bacteria burst open. It would replicate and make thousands of copies of itself
- A virus is very simple, it has an exterior layer, a capsid made of protein and inside the capsid is DNA.

> ### How do we figure out whether it was the protein or DNA affecting the bacteria?
>
> We can fluorescently tag the DNA and protein. We can do the tagging by injecting a radioactive material. Since Sulphur is present in Protein and not DNA, we can make the virus duplicate in the presence of sulphur. S^35^ is the isotope to be used. Methionine is used.
>
> DNA has Phosphorous but not Proteins. So we can use P^32^.

- Now, when we mix the virus with bacteria, the virus will attach itself to the bacteria. We need to seperate this. We can do this by blending the bacteria and virus.
- We need to use a blender to knock off the viruses from the bacteria causing the virus to go floating around. We then need to seperate the viruses and bacteria using a centrifuge.
- The denser bacteria go to the bottom and the lighter viruses go into the supernatant. We see that Phosphorous is present. Therefore, we know the inner DNA is what causes the virus to spread.

### Question 2

The capsid, or coat of a bacteriophage, is composed of what? Which isotope did Hershey and Chase use to label the capsid? Check the best answer.

#### Answer 2

Protein, S^35^

## DNA Structure

% of A == % of T
% of C == % of G

### Question 3

If the sequence of double-stranded DNA includes 12% guanine, what percent adenine would you expect? Select the best answer.

#### Answer 3

38%

> Explanation
> G == C. Therefore, G = 12%, so C = 12%. Total = 24%
> A == T. Therefore, A + T + 24 = 100%, 2A + 24 = 100
> A = 76/2 = 38%
